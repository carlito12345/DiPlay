- Support optional GD vehicle bridge instrument-mode leases after the first actual map frame, with restoration on exit.
- Keep the existing signing identity and Android 9 minimum. Vehicle behavior requires physical validation.

# DiPlay 0.2.13 — 2026-10-06

- Enable the legacy Android 9 Wi-Fi Direct group path with generated credentials and serialized ownership/cleanup; requested frequency remains unverified on Android 9 (#282).
- Prefer current IPv4 hotspot endpoints, preserve scoped IPv6 fallback, and refine Auto channel priorities beside a 5 GHz station without guaranteeing a band (#283, #309).
- Avoid unused Android NSD and USB-service dependencies for wireless startup; retain only rendered sessions on the guarded handoff fallback (#313, #300, #258).
- Add explicit experimental hotspot join Check/Apply/Restore on eligible Android 13+, user-configured 5 GHz hotspots, with complete private recovery state and no automatic mutation (#251).

- Set TCP_NODELAY on the touch event channel; contributor latency observations remain device-specific (#311).
- Improve full-size multi-window home/settings appearance, ambient-setting visibility and shared menu persistence; add main-settings car-button customization (#252, #239, #281, #302).
- Add light waiting/cluster placeholders and a 300 ms cluster fade; the main waiting screen follows CarPlay day/night mode (#305, #317).
- Add Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) as the seventh app language, preserve explicit script selection and correct Simplified Chinese hotspot wording (#314, #286). The release website also gains a Traditional Chinese edition.
- Retain the multilingual website groundwork, add the smooth-wireless guide and make buffered-ownership tests deterministic without runtime/API changes (#240, #310, #312).

See [0.2.13 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.13.md) for all 35 contribution links, credits, experimental settings, compatibility limits and diagnostic export steps. Final exact-release validation is recorded in [VALIDATION](docs/VALIDATION.md). This remains a public preview; no fresh complete-release vehicle test is claimed.

- Add automatic wireless setup that uses an active car hotspot when available and otherwise prepares a compatible connection with the correct network name and password.
- Use the car's current hotspot password on Android 9 when the system makes it available, so wireless CarPlay does not keep retrying with outdated saved details.
- Prefer the hotspot's IPv4 connection on older Geely head units and recognize steering-button press and release events on more Geely models.
- Let steering-button identification learn the wider range of key codes reported by OneOS head units.

# DiPlay 0.2.12 — 2026-10-04

- Add Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN wireless CarPlay with scoped IPv4/IPv6 discovery and network-change cleanup (#223).

- Switch supported dashboard contents live using actual delivery and safely retained paused choices; preserve selection across stream/phone replacement (#232).
- Add a five-second dashboard-song-on-change window with timer invalidation, and retain album art while the next transfer is pending (#215, #228).
- Export reports through Downloads, document picker, app-external or private fallback storage, with explicit View/Share actions (#185, #219).

See [0.2.12 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.12.md) for the complete corrections, hardware evidence and issue-reporting steps. This remains a public preview; no fresh end-to-end vehicle test of the complete repaired release is claimed.

# DiPlay 0.2.11 — 2026-10-03

- Add preferred Wi-Fi Direct channel selection for the next connection; Auto remains the default, and manual channel rejection/mismatch reports an error (#175).
- Add a movable custom dashboard turn card with 2% position steps; leave unknown arrows blank and clear expired guidance (#155).
- Offer two-, three- or four-finger settings swipes, keeping three as the default (#156).
- Add opt-in read-only legacy vehicle-data detection while preserving default DiLink 5.0 mode; reject unaccepted/stale probe publication and fix accepted-battery lock ordering (#158, integrated through #173).
- Keep wireless location/vehicle data on its runtime Wi-Fi link and defer parked-video decisions until SETUP/event readiness (#157).
- Add optional automatic car-hotspot startup, off by default, with verified own-package authorization and unified vehicle settings (#164/#173).
- Support Android TV/remote controls while preserving head-unit touchscreen Back and absolute knob X/Y; keep its workflow source-only (#146).
- Retain artists across partial title updates and publish song metadata/artwork only when changed (#161, #162).
- Correct Android 9 audio API use, release failed codecs, reconnect with settled geometry/readiness, and require own-app VPN scope (#168 and local corrections).
- Add one guarded Auto-mode API 29 P2P recovery for the exact reported pre-create Builder error, plus bounded wireless/media/theme/own-app-exit diagnostics without payload recording or automatic uploads.

See [0.2.11 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.11.md) for requirements, device-test limits and fresh-report guidance. Preferred channel selection does not establish stutter as fixed; Qin Plus, Siri, iOS 15 and day/night reports remain under investigation. Android 9 is still the minimum; Wi-Fi Direct needs Android 10+.

# DiPlay 0.2.10 — 2026-10-03

- Publish CarPlay song metadata, position and artwork to Android media sessions; bound artwork queues and reject stale work across sessions (#82).
- Preserve normal USBMUX frames while handling narrowly validated handshake padding (#114); let USB connect without saved wireless-hotspot credentials (#130).
- Handle unknown reported Wi-Fi Direct security types, retry busy channels and allow bounded 5 GHz fallback (#121).
- Select an available AirPlay port and advertise it over Bonjour and wired/wireless iAP2; close sockets on failed setup/notification (#143).
- Enable available platform echo cancellation and noise suppression for calls, restoring the previous mode afterward (#116).
- Detect BYD CAN/CANFD battery protocols and clear unsupported/stale readings (#123).
- Add a saved show/hide setting for the home-screen dashboard-map mirror (#133).
- Improve optional parked video with seeking and ten-second skip controls; validate media URLs and redirects (#129).
- Extend Ukrainian translations, including the new map-mirror setting (#128 and release localization).
- Add bounded anonymous Bluetooth/USB/boot and microphone capture/encode/send diagnostics to exported reports; omit audio and packet contents.

See [0.2.10 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.10.md) for contributor credits, requirements and validation limits. Android 9 remains the minimum supported version.

# DiPlay 0.2.9 — 2026-10-02

- Follow BYD head-unit day/night changes while CarPlay is visible, including firmware that does not reliably deliver Android configuration callbacks.
- Restore media and navigation audio stream selection to 0–20 and inherit older saved navigation settings when no new selection exists. Vendor-specific outputs depend on head-unit support.
- Keep CarPlay connected through normal surround-view window changes, preserving video proportions and touch alignment. A connection started in a narrow camera window reconnects once when the window grows to restore the full-screen canvas.
- Add Ukrainian to the app language picker, Android app-language settings, and website. Correct its audio help to describe streams 1–20.
- Add an optional CarPlay song title, artist, and play/pause display on the BYD instrument cluster, using the existing network ADB connection.
- Add a CarPlay navigation widget for launchers that host standard Android widgets, with the next turn, road, distance, arrival information, and song. Clear expired guidance and explicitly cleared song titles.
- Add an optional floating copy of the dashboard map on the centre screen, with drag, pinch-to-resize, and tap-to-open controls. Requires permission to draw over other apps; Usage Access restricts it to home screens.
- Fix floating-map resizing on head units that ignore small pinch gestures.
- Let compatible launchers embed the live dashboard map on Android 11 and newer. Sharing is off by default; turning it off closes existing shared map views.
- Add map-host and DiPlay Home sample apps for developers. DiPlay Home combines the live map, standard Android widgets, a clock, and an app list; sample builds, lint, and Home back-navigation tests are checked in CI.
- Leave the GPS course empty when its direction is unknown, instead of reporting north. Valid GPS directions are preserved.
- Thanks to @lpcheng1208 for PRs [#71](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/pull/71), [#88](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/pull/88), and [#89](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/pull/89).

# DiPlay 0.2.8 — 2026-09-30

- Keep iPhone location reporting active across the wireless Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi CarPlay handoff; limit location updates to one per second on wireless and USB.
- Add optional ADB wheel-speed and gear reporting for iPhone dead reckoning when GPS is unavailable. Tunnel use has not yet been verified.
- Add optional iOS 27 video playback on the car screen while parked, with iPhone, touchscreen and steering-wheel controls; close playback when leaving P.
- Explain unsupported DRM-protected video such as Apple TV+, which requires a licensed FairPlay receiver.
- Improve playback error reporting and preserve CarPlay when the head unit cannot play a video.

# DiPlay 0.2.7 — 2026-09-29

- App interface in English, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Spanish; synchronized Android app-language settings.
- Steering-wheel media controls and long-press Siri on supported BYD firmware while CarPlay is on screen.
- Dashboard display choices: map, turn card, or both; corrected dashboard keyframe recovery.
- Optional ADB feature on supported DiLink 5.0: pause the dashboard map stream when its display mode hides the map.
- Optional ADB battery reporting for Apple Maps, with warning threshold, charging-connector selection and a checked reconnect action.
- Audio playback reliability fixes and clearer dashboard settings.
- Clarify the BYD-only support scope on the README and all five website editions.

# 0.2.0 — BYD navigation and connection improvements

- Standalone windshield HUD arrows, distance and street names on the verified DiLink5.1 firmware; no ADB, root or computer helper.
- Retain contributor cluster/SOME-IP navigation, route parsing, BYD CarPlay icon and display-size presets.
- Fix Car hotspot startup by using scoped IPv6 when available and binding discovery/probing to the AP interface. Physically confirmed on the development car.
- Drain asynchronously decoded audio during packet gaps and rebuild the music buffer after starvation. Wi-Fi Direct is much better in the user retest; occasional audio cutouts remain for a later version.
- Preserve bounded music-buffer choices, USB read improvements and decoder recovery; fix USB request/close races and keep vendor output outside phone callbacks.
- Save audio/video/receive timing and discovery diagnostics without road names or protocol payloads.
- HUD cleanup on normal end/disconnect/off/stale input; interrupted sessions recover on the next app launch. Force-stop may leave guidance visible until reopening.
- Thanks to @romanchukg-cloud and @georgiyrr for PR #3 and vehicle testing.

# 0.1.0 release restored — 2026-09-25

- Rebuilt and signed the APK locally with explicitly supplied runtime authentication assets.
- Restored release downloads; no app behavior or version-code change from 0.1.0.
- Accessory identity remains in the APK only. No credential files enter Git or the source archive.
- Retained generated test identities and public-source credential checks.
- Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default; local packaging requires an explicit external directory.

# Source reset — 2026-09-25

- Withdrew the 0.1.0 APK and removed its release tag.
- Reset the public branch after preserving restricted local incident records.
- Removed static synthetic test private keys; generate test identities at runtime.
- Removed automatic private-asset packaging and disabled the old release build script.
- Added a build guard rejecting credential asset files.
- Replaced the download site with a five-language suspension notice.

The APK was subsequently rebuilt and restored as described above. Existing copies cannot be recalled by a Git history reset.
